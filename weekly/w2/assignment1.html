	<h2>The Bad</h2>

	<p>I found that Myspace.com had bad web design. When first opening the page, you are assaulted by many different calls to action on the website and your eyes don’t know where to look. The main features and navigation bar of the website are all very small compared to the rest of the media, and the color, font, and size all blend in with one another. The navigation also does not follow your webpage so if you scroll down you cannot access the quick filters which would be helpful. Once you do find your place however, the overall design becomes much cleaner, there is much less clutter, and everything is laid out simply and cleanly.</p>

	<h2>The Good</h2>

	<p>I believe that Youtube.com is laid out smartly. When first opening the site, you are greeted with the trending ribbon where everything is laid out clearly and uniformly. The color of the website is also white which highlights the thumbnails much better then a darker color and adds to the thought that this website is clean and uniform. Scrolling down, the rest of the website and thumbnails are laid out the same which creates familiarity so that you are never confused while browsing the website. The website also has a ribbon that scrolls with the page so that you have constant access to it. It has common filters for exploration which lets new people to the site explore much easier while also providing a short list of subscriptions if the user has any. One thing I don’t like about the site is how the following ribbon has a scroll bar of its own, the ribbon should be self-contained and lead to easy access to whatever it is they are promoting. For example, if you have a large number of subscriptions you can click a drop down menu to expand it to see all of your subs. I think if they wanted to include the settings and other information they should list it under a simple drop down menu as well.</p>

	<p>http://studio323.com</p>
	
	<p>I found that our class’ own Studio323.com website is laid out very well. The design is very simple while having a nice cool color accent on the side to accentuate the text that highlights when you hover over it. A number of websites also include the function of highlighting when you hover over links, but this websites font and size make it very clear when you are hovering over something and keeps the menu selections very simple which a lot of other websites do not. This website also keeps everything on one page whether it be with a simple scroll down or having the page be laid out in such a way that everything can be displayed on one screen. If the page does have a scroll bar, everything is kept very uniform and is laid out very closely to the rest of the website.</p>
