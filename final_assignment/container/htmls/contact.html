				<p>Jesse Sheeler is a 3D artist who works with creative and passionate designers to achieve their artistic ideas while ensuring quality and unique problem solving.</p>

				<p>Jesse believes that 3D art and animation is important for conveying creative ideas. Ever since first playing video games, I have been enamored by the 3D worlds created by game designers which could take me to worlds unknown and tell stories that I would never have dreamed of. I know that I have the ability to bring peoplesâ€™ creative visions to fruition while also bringing my unique creative spin to it so that others can experience what I did while growing up.</p>
				
				<p>Jesse has worked with numerous groups of creative game designers while at George Mason.</p>
