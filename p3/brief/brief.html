	<h1>Design Brief</h1>
	
	<p>
	After having done research on what makes a good portfolio and also seeking advice from professors in my college, I have deduced that a very visual portfolio style suits my needs best. I am going to make sure my work is front and center and very visually appealing in its layout. My website should be easy to navigate and draw the user in closer and deeper into the website to incentivize them to continue looking at my work. I will be taking pictures and gifs of the work I have created in the game design program.
