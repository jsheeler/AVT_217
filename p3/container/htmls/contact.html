			<p>Jesse believes that 3D art and animation is important for conveying creative ideas. Ever since first playing video games, I have been enamored by the 3D worlds created by game designers which could take me to worlds unknown and tell stories that I would never have dreamed of. I know that I have the ability to bring peoples’ creative visions to fruition while also bringing my unique creative spin to it so that others can experience what I did while growing up.</p>
				
			<p>Jesse has worked with numerous groups of creative game designers while at George Mason.</p>
